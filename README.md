You will need nodejs (npm), react, (anaconda) python 3.6+ along with all the python libraries.

run npm install to get packages for node and react

You will have to do conda install <package_name> for all the python dependencies (e.g. conda install tensorflow) in anaconda prompt

To run everything 
	-run voiceText.py as the voice-to-text backend
	-run aslText.py as the asl-to-text backend
	-run npm start in the asl-remastered dir level
